## Plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
data("instacart")
```


### Scatterplot

The number of orders from each department. 
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(department) %>% 
  mutate(
    department = factor(department),
    department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly (x = ~department, y = ~n, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5)
```

### Boxplot 

```{r}
instacart1 = instacart %>% 
  filter(product_id < 50)
```

```{r}
instacart1 %>% 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, days_since_prior_order)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~days_since_prior_order, color = ~department, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

### Histogram 

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(department) %>% 
  mutate(
    department = factor(department),
    department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly (x = ~department, color = ~department, y = ~n, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```

nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
